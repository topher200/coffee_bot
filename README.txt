# FarSounder's Android CoffeeBot

## Introduction
   One of the biggest issues plaguing FarSounder developers is knowing when
   fresh coffee is being brewed. CoffeeBot solves this problem by tweeting
   whenever it detects a new pot.

   CoffeeBot runs on an old G1 (the original Android phone!), mounted the top
   lid of the FarSounder coffee pot. When the phone is flipped in a certain
   way, CoffeeBot knows that the lid has been opened and someone is brewing
   coffee. It posts a tweet to @FSCoffeeBot, where all followers can get the
   message.
